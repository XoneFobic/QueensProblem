# Queen's Problem (Brute forcing the solution)

For a job interview I was asked to solve the queen's problem for a 7x7 chess-board.

## Requirements

* Have PHP setup on your machine and accessible through the terminal

## Running the code

* Go to the folder where the `QueensProblem.php` is located.
* run `php QueensProblem.php`

Now it'll print all the found solutions, including a printed count before and after showing all the solutions.

## Disclaimer

As the test didn't specify that a framework nor a browser interface was required, I went with the most straight forward solution and print it all to console.  

`QueensProblem` is a class, which means it should be fairly easy to import it into any project, just dont forget to remove the lines at the bottom. Else it'll try and output it.
